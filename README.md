# ShaderPostPTool
 A post-processing tool for Godot projects
 Grab the PostProcessToolExample.exe and ~.pck and run the executable to get a small taste of what this tool can do. In this case it creates a CCTV security camera effect, side by side with the original image for comparison. 
 The tool can do a retro CRT tv emulation filter, color adjustment, color splash, vignettes, blur, chromatic abberation, photo negative, and pixelization.
